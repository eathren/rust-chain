## NEU Blockchain

This is a POW (Proof-of-work) blockchain project built by the northeastern blockchain club.

It is built in rust. If you're not familiar, you can find the rust book [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). Rust is a lovely compiled language that designed for performance and memory-safety. It's similiar to C++, but guarantees memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

### Description

This project is designed as a learning experiment to introduce new and experienced developers to exactly what it takes to build a functioning blockchain. As such, the only purprose for it is that it runs, while this may be open to interpretation down the road. It is <b> not </b> intended to be a currency in any way, shape, or form.

### Installation

Clone the repo with git clone. From there, run with cargo.

If you don't have cargo installed, [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is a good on how to do so.

In the command-line, type <code> cargo run</code> and the project will start.
